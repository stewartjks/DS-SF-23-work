Specifically, I found that the sole red flag prior to regression was that there was some intercorrelation between GRE and GPA (0.38). While not so significant as to suggest the two variables could not be regressed together, I determined that the autocorrelation should prompt some caution around dispersion of signal between these two variables when regressed together. Finally, I outlined an analysis plan informed by my findings in exploration.\n",

Along similar lines as the z-scores from the regression, a one unit increase in GRE score increased odds of acceptance by 1%, while a one unit increase in GPA corresponded to a 40% decrease in odds of admission. Applying from a school with prestige 1 increased chance of admission 265% (compared to prestige 2-4), while applying from a prestige 2 school increased odds of admission 65%, and applying from a prestige 3 school decreased odds of admission by 5%."
