The t-statistic (20.278) is much greater than the typical threshold for significance (>2), and the p-value is well below the standard 0.025 threshold. However, the correlation coefficient lies within the 95% CI, so we can't say that this result is statistically significant by this measure."

    "Answer: This relationship may be likely masking large variations in the relationship betweeen body size and brain size based on the type of animal in question, so, before we can say that it is biologically significant, we'd need to know if this association is replicable when segmented by animal type. This is because the biologically significant question is how tight the relationship is between an increase in body size and increase in brain size. For example, it would be trivial to say that brain size increases as we go from ants to dogs to tigers, because every aspect of each successive animal is many times larger. If, on the other hand, we saw that all (or nearly all) species saw incremental increases in brain size in tandem with larger body size, this would demonstrate a consistent relationship that may involve a causal mechanism (i.e., a process by which having a larger body makes having a larger brain more likely)."
